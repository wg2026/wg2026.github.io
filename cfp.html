<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<p>
We invite authors to submit papers describing original research of theoretical or practical significance to the 52nd International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG 2026), which will will take place from Tuesday June 2nd to Thursday June 4th 2026 in Kortrijk, Belgium.
</p>

<h2>Aims and Scope</h2>

<p>WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g., sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Submitted papers should describe original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to:</p>

<ul>
<li>design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms</li>
<li>distributed graph and network algorithms</li>
<li>structural graph theory</li>
<li>computational complexity of graph and network problems</li>
<li>graph drawing and layouts</li>
<li>computational geometry</li>
<li>computational biology</li>
<li>graph mining</li>
<li>random graphs and models of the web and scale-free networks</li>
<li>support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>

<p>Note: All deadlines are 23:59 in <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe">AoE time zone</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Abstract submission deadline: 1 February 2026</li>
<li>Paper submission deadline: 4 February 2026</li>
<li>Acceptance notification: 3 April 2026</li>
<li>Final versions due: 4 May 2026</li>  
<li>Conference: 2-4 June 2026</li>  
</ul>


<h2>Submission and Proceedings</h2>

<p>
WG 2026 is the first WG edition to have LIPIcs proceedings. The conference will use a lightweight double-blind model for the reviewing process. For more details on the format, see below.
</p>


<p>
Submissions should be made through EasyChair, using the following link: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wg2026" rel="external">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wg2026</a>
</p>

<!--
<p>
Submissions should be made through EasyChair, but the submission server is still closed for now. The submission server will open in December 2025.
</p>
-->

<p>
All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the paper in person at the conference.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>
<p>
Each submission is required to be in the LIPIcs format and must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines. In order to encourage authors to include pictures, we will follow  other conferences in the field and limit the number of lines instead of the number of pages.
Authors are required to use the LaTeX class file <a href="documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">socg-lipics-v2021.cls (V0.9, Sep 19, 2022)</a>, with the option "anonymous"; note that the class file is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class. The LIPIcs style and instructions are available <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publishing/series/details/lipics#author">here</a>; the SoCG class file is available <a href="documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls">here</a>, and instructions on how to use it are available here <a href="documents/linecount_2022_09_19.pdf">here</a>. Submissions <b>must not exceed 500 lines</b> as counted by the cls file which is mandatory for the submission (which corresponds to roughly 12 pages), excluding references. Submissions that do not follow these guildelines, or visibly try to circumvent them (e.g., by including blocks of text in figures or equations) might be rejected without review. All details, including proofs, that are not included due to the space limit, should be added in a clearly marked appendix, to be read by program committee members and reviewers at their discretion. The length of the appendix is not constrained.
</p>


<h3>Double-blind Reviewing</h3>
<p>WG 2026 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with any questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs.
</p>

<h3>Conflicts of Interest</h3>
<p>Due to double-blind reviewing, the authors are required to indicate Conflicts of Interest with PC members on EasyChair. A CoI is limited to the following categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Family member or close friend.</li>
<li>Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.</li>
<li>Same affiliation.</li>
<li>Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)</li>
<li>Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).</li>
<li>Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.</li>  
</ul>


<h2>Awards</h2>
<p>WG 2026 will offer awards for the best paper and the best student paper. The awards will be decided by the program committee. The committee can decide to split the awards over multiple papers, or not to offer an award.
Papers eligible for the best student paper can have non-student co-authors, but the main work in a paper that is a candidate for the best student paper award must be done by co-authors that were students at the time of submission, and the award can be received only by such co-authors. It must be indicated at the time of submission whether a paper is a candidate for this award.
